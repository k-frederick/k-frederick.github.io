So, I've gotten through learning about setting up GitHub and how gems work. I've gotten partway through the introduction to Ruby, and I have a few thoughts so far. I have a little experience with HTML and CSS, but none with Ruby. When I began learning HTML, I thought it was quite straightforward and almost intuitive on some levels. Ruby has been a slightly different story. I find that sometimes, I'll go over the same lesson or lab a few times just to be sure I have the material down really well. I really like how thoughtful Yukihuro Matsumoto was when creating this language. Thus far, I've enjoyed learning about variables and methods. I have a background in tutoring foreign languages, so for me, I feel like I have something to connect my background with when learning these new concepts for web development. I will keep pushing forward and making sure that I understand how methods work even if it means I need to slow down a little bit and take some extra time to really solidify the concepts and practice more. I'm excited to dig deeper into Ruby to see how it will play a role in future projects!
