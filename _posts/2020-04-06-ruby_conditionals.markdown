This last week, I explored conditionals used in Ruby. I was pleasantly surprised to find that "if," elsif," and "else" statements used in Ruby are quite similar to the concepts I learned in my symbolic logic class in undergrad. I definitely thought the labs for section 6 would be easy, but they still challenged me. One thing I've realized while learning Ruby is how exact you must be with your syntax, which all in all is a good thing in my opinion. Well, needless to say, it did take me a while to pass my tests, but I persevered and finished them all.
