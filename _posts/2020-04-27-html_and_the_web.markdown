This week, I began exploring HTML. Before starting my program here at Flatiron School, I was actually learning a little HTML through a different bootcamp before deciding to make the switch. This was definitely a nice break after seemingly endless hours of tic tac toe in Ruby!

So far, I'm loving this little introduction to HTML. One of my favorite aspects is the accessbility. I am mentally making notes as I go through the program, thinking about what will be important to me in my future role as a developer. Some of my friends and acquaintances have disabilities, so accessibility is very important to me.

I learned how to properly format HTML documents. Here is an example of what I did this week:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Potato Farming</title>
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
```

I also learned about anchor tags with HREF and how to use them. I'm a little sad to stop learning HTML and CSS for now and switch back to Ruby, but I'm excited to keep exploring web development even further.
